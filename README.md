This is a simple rootkit that I'm using as an excuse to learn more about the linux kernel.

It also hides itself from the module list (shown with lsmod) and sysfs.

There are several features that can be enabled with the provided metasploit modules.

This is meant entirely for educational purposes. Use at your own risk.
